**Hotel California**

On a dark desert highway cool wind in my hair

Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air

Up ahead in the distance I saw a shimmering light

My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim

I had to stop for the night

There she stood in the doorway;

I heard the mission bell

And I was thinking to myself

’This could be Heaven or this could be Hell’

Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way

There were voices down the corridor,

I thought I heard them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely place

Such a lovely face

Plenty of room at the Hotel California

Any time of year, you can find it here


月黑大漠路迢迢，风高凛冽客思归，

人倦眼乏昏欲睡，闻香忽见灯火碎，

但见有女娉婷立，耳畔钟声如乐起，

天堂地狱两相忘，浑然不似在人间，

秉烛引路过画廊，人声嘈杂迎客至：

加州客栈诚待客，虚位以侯游子回，


Her mind is Tiffany- twisted, she got the Mercedes bends

She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys, that she calls friends

How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.

Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

So I called up the Captain,

’Please bring me my wine’

He said,’We haven’t had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine’

And still those voices are calling from far away,

Wake you up in the middle of the night

Just to hear them say...

Welcome to the Hotel California

Such a lovely place

Such a lovely face

They livin’ it up at the Hotel California

What a nice surprise, bring your alibis

衣香鬓影佳人意，玉郎终始为君来，

放歌纵舞前廊院，香汗淋漓未尽欢：

纵使笙歌能醉月，情未忘我怎忘情？

便向校官索美酒，经年未备意阑珊，

午夜梦回旧馆舍，声声呼唤充耳闻，

倦鸟羁留深林久，此间乐哉不思飞，


Mirrors on the ceiling,

The pink champagne on ice

And she said ’We are all just prisoners here, of our own device’

And in the master’s chambers,

They gathered for the feast

The stab it with their steely knives,　

But they just can’t kill the beast　　

Last thing I remember, I was

Running for the door

I had to find the passage back

To the place I was before

’Relax,’said the night man,

We are programmed to receive.

You can checkout any time you like,

but you can never leave


宝镜倒映烛影晃，寒冰装点酒色红，

宾客齐至成盛筵，佳人美酒俱添光，

轻启朱唇惊四座，投杯停箸不能食：

钢刀银叉手中持，心魔犹在不能消，

自我羁押成囚徒，吾辈颓然尚不知。

闻言惊觉寻旧路，四顾茫茫无着处，

明朝更向何处去？更者悠然言少歇：

纵然我辈长别离，此生有命不能弃，

前路漫漫归旧旅，生此回环无尽时。


**Scarborough Fair**

问尔所之，是否如适 Are you going to Scarborough Fair

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme

彼方淑女，凭君寄辞 Remember me to one who lives there

伊人曾在，与我相知 She once was a true love of mine

嘱彼隹人，备我衣缁 Tell her to make me a cambric shirt

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme

勿用针剪，无隙无疵 Without no seams nor needle work

伊人何在，慰我相思 Then she will be a true love of mine

彼山之阴，深林荒址 On the side of hill in the deep forest green

冬寻毡毯，老雀燕子 Tracing of sparrow on snow crested brown

雪覆四野，高山迟滞 Blankets and bed clothes the child of maintain

眠而不觉，寒笳清嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

嘱彼隹人，营我家室 Tell her to find me an acre of land

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme

良田所修，大海之坻 Between the salt water and the sea strand

伊人应在，任我相视 Then she will be a true love of mine

彼山之阴，叶疏苔蚀 On the side of hill a sprinkling of leaves

涤彼孤冢，珠泪渐撤 Washes the grave with slivery tears

昔我长剑，日日拂拭 A soldier cleans and polishes a gun

寂而不觉，寒笳长嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call

嘱彼隹人，收我秋实 Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather

蕙兰芫荽，郁郁香芷 Parsley sage rosemary and thyme

敛之集之，勿弃勿失 And gather it all in a bunch of heather

伊人犹在，唯我相誓 Then she will be a ture love of mine

烽火印啸，浴血之师 War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions

将帅有令，勤王之事 Generals order their soldiers to kill and to fight for a cause

争斗缘何，久忘其旨 They have long ago forgotten

痴而不觉，寒笳悲嘶 Sleeps unaware of the clarion call
