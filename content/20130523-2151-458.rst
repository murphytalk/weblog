When I was moving to my new home one year ago, there was one thing upset me : the tower building I was moving in hires this ISP who, although offer a quite fast 1G Internet connection, does not give me public IP address.

I have been running my little home server for years, and having a home server which I can connect to at anywhere and anytime has become so nature.



But compared with a public IP, a brand new comfortable home is more attractive, so I had to accept it, although reluctantly.

Now one year has passed, I  just realized I am already hosting a pretty chunk of my digital life in the clouds:

- Close to 10,000 thousands of pictures on Flicker.
- Dropbox to sync personal data between home computers and smartphone.
- This is the latest : I start to host my git repositories on Bitbucket_.
 
As for the home server?  Yes I still have it which is basically my data store with daily incremental backup ; and No I no longer need to access it when I am not at home now :)
