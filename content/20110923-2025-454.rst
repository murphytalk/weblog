I have been running MoinMoin on my LinkStation for years. While it is not a bad solution, it is surely kinda slow.So it occurred to me that how sweet it can be if I can leverage the power of Google AppEngine. 

Did some search on the Internet,except on MoinMoin's official site it is mentioned vaguely that there was an attempt by 3rd party to migrate the data back-end to GAE , I found nothing.

**UPDATE 2012/1/3**
So I spent sometime to do this by myself during the new year holidays. It is feasible I would say: my idea is to replace all hard coded file I/O with GAE's Datastore.

To minimize the changes to the MoinMoin code, I decided to treat each directory and file of the original MoinMoin file based storage as a entity in the GAE Datastore.The GAE data model uses pathname as the index, will have other properties to indicate if it is a directory or file, creation/update timestamp, a reference to its parent directory entity.

Thanks to WSGI , I have managed to plug a MoinMoin WSGI application into the GAE framework. Still have lots of works need to be done though.
