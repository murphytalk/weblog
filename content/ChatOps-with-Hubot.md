Well , this very topic of [ChatOps](https://www.google.co.jp/?ion=1&espv=2#q=chatops) has already been discussed at length by many people, so I am gonna jump to my very first ChatOps with Hubot  right away.

First : the motivation.

I have discovered [Anki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)) for quite a while, it helps me to increase my English vocabulary - and my kid's Chinese vocabulary as well. It comes with a mobile app (only the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en) is free, but I am sure Apple fanboys won't mind to pay extra for their beloved iPhone) which is handy, but still whenever I wanted to add a new word that I bumped into during my reading, it does not feel that convinent: You know what I mean if you have ever tried to manually add a new word to Anki.

Enter [anki-sync-server](https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server).

In short, it is a private Anki sync server, and most beautifully, it comes with a super cool (but badly documented) [RESTful API](https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server/wiki/RESTful-API-Documentation) which makes automation possible. And being a lazy engineer, I love to automate things.

Well, to be fair, the document is not that bad if you read [the code](https://github.com/dsnopek/anki-sync-server/blob/master/AnkiServer/apps/rest_app.py) very carefully. Here's what I've figured out.

1. Collection - the name is kind of miss leading in my opinion. Actually, the collection name is just your user name.
2. All requests must be sent as POST.
3. Anki manages words by using notes: a note is where you put your new word and its explanation etc. You only add note but not card, the latter  is generated by Anki automatically to reflect on side of the note (remember you can have reversed card).

Use `wget` to try some quick examples.

List all decks:

```bash
wget --post-data='{}'  --header "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:27701/collection/username/list_deck
```

List all models (card types):

```bash
wget --post-data='{}'  --header "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:27701/collection/username/list_models
```

Finally, my goal : add a new word as note

```bash
wget --post-data='{"model":"English","fields":{"Word":"exasperate","Meaning":"irritate intensely; infuriate","Phonetic":"/ɪɡˈzasp(ə)reɪt,ɛɡ-/","Reverse":"y"}}'  --header "Accept: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:27701/collection/username/add_note
```

Next: the goal.

With the logistics being sorted out, here's the deal : next time when I bump into a word that I don't recognize and know, I will paste the word to my slack channle where my bot is wating for commands, and I want my bot to figure out the new word's meaning, pronounciation as well, and then add the results it found to Anki automatically. All I need to do later is to sync my Anki app with my private Anki server.

Obviously the bot would need a dictionary, and lucky for him the [Longman dictionary API](http://developer.pearson.com/apis/dictionaries) is free for up to 4,000,000 calls per month (Thank you! Pearson Inc !!).

Again, a quick `wget` example:

```bash
wget --header "Accept: application/json" http://api.pearson.com/v2/dictionaries/ldoce5/entries?headword=exasperate

```

`ldoce5` is the ID of Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English. Note GET is used. Multiple results will be returned as a JSON object.
