I have always been good at wasting time ... even there is some important agenda is waiting I could still manage to scrounge some time to kill, to do something totally irrelevant ... I am coerced by that little daemon hidden in the very deep of my heart.

Then I would feel guilty about the wasted time, repentantly ... but that won't last long, I know I would do that again, covertly ...
