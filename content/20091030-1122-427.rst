I have been using Dirvish to backup my home server for like 2 years, am happy with it. Today I noticed there are several other backup tools `out there <http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/02/backup-on-linux-rsnapshot-vs-rdiff/>`_ , and some of them look promising, for example : rdiff-backup,which supports increase backup compression.
